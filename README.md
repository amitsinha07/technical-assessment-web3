Overview:
Develop a simple frontend application that allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet and mint an NFT using a smart contract.

Details:     
1. Setup Instructions
Technology Stack: You should use React (or another frontend framework of their choice) and ethers.js or web3.js for blockchain interactions.
Smart Contract: Provide a simple NFT smart contract deployed on a test network (e.g., Rinkeby or Ropsten). Include the contract address and ABI (Application Binary Interface).

2. Requirements

1) Connect to MetaMask:
The application should include a button that allows the user to connect to their MetaMask wallet.
Upon successful connection, display the user’s Ethereum address on the UI.
2) Mint NFT Functionality:
Include a form where users can input metadata for a new NFT (e.g., a title and a URI for the token).
When the user submits the form, call the smart contract's mint function to create a new NFT.
Display a success message once the transaction is confirmed, or an error message if the transaction fails.
3) Error Handling:
Handle user errors, such as rejecting the MetaMask connection or invalid input in the minting form. Display appropriate messages to the user.

3. Deliverables
A GitHub repository containing the code.
A README file with:
Instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.
Any relevant documentation for your smart contract and how to interact with it.

4. Evaluation Criteria
Code Quality: Cleanliness, organization, and readability of the code.
Functionality: The application meets all specified requirements and functions as intended.
User Experience: The UI should be intuitive and user-friendly.
Error Handling: Proper management of errors and feedback to the user.
Bonus (Optional):
Implement a feature that displays the user’s NFTs in their wallet.
Add tests for the smart contract interaction using a testing framework like Hardhat or Truffle.


Note: Upon successful completion and delivery of this task within the specified timeline, we will compensate you with a payment of $ 100, payable in your choice of Ethereum, Solana, BNB, or Tron.
